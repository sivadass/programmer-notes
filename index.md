After completing over 300 IT projects, I’ve learned one thing: 

Frameworks like Agile, Scrum, and Six Sigma are great… in theory.

In real life? Projects rarely go as planned.

Why? Because things happen.
- Plans change.
- Approvals get stuck.
- Shipments are late.
- People on medical leave.

And suddenly, that perfect framework feels useless.

Sound familiar?

Here’s what I’ve learned after 300+ IT projects:

- Start with the End Date: Lock in your target deadline. That’s your anchor.
- Work Backwards: Build the timeline in reverse. It’s the only way to stay realistic.
- Set Milestones: Break the project into chunks you can actually hit.
- Focus, Focus, Focus: Forget perfection. Just hit those milestones, one by one.

That’s it. 

No over-complicating. Just clear steps to move forward.

My Biggest Takeaway

Frameworks are helpful, but flexibility wins. 
Plans change, and that’s okay. 

The goal isn’t to follow a framework — it’s to deliver results.

What about you? How do you handle it when plans fall apart?
